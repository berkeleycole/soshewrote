		For better or worse, I’m a chart person. And while choosing a typeface for my last few projects, I’ve wished there was a chart I could refer to for typeface uses and a few simple yet complementing pairings. So, I finally made one…or a few.

		**Keep in mind that this article was made with only web content in mind.

 




		Pairings

		Pairing typefaces always seemed overwhelming to me. The only way to know it works is if …. it just works. Thankfully though, there are some principles, which make choosing less of a blindfolded dart game and give a more logical path to follow. Here is the process that I typically use when choosing typefaces.

		Do I even need two typefaces?   It had been a subconscious assumption as I started out in web design that a serious website had a minimum of two typefaces. I had always learned to pair one serif with a sans serif. Writing this article I finally went to some big websites expressly to check if this is true. Turns out that often it is, but only when looking at news, research, or academic sites. Most websites having to do with tech or social media stick to one sans serif typeface. What I learned is to never think that your website needs many different typefaces to be taken seriously. It is in fact the opposite on many cases. Using one typeface and exploring all of its fonts (bold, italic, many different sizes, even color) to create diversity for the reading eye is a guaranteed way to make sure there is harmony of type on your page while at the same time keeping it interesting.  
		A typeface that fits my goals.  Consider your purpose. Are you creating a website for a tech startup? a local news report? An app? Check the Uses section of the charts. Most major categories will be associated with at least one category. Use that as a starting place. There is nothing to stop you from completely deviating from convention on this, but if you do, know your own reasons for doing so. 

		Two fonts would help me with my design goals. I have picked one, but I need another that complements it.  This is in fact the main motivation behind the chart. By separating typefaces into groups that share common traits, it is easier to know where to start looking. For instance, if you have chosen a humanist serif for your website’s big headline, then you can simply run through a list of humanist sans serifs to choose your second. In the same way the transitional serif and sans fonts typically work together very well. It also pays to check - some typefaces even come with a serif and sans serif version (Droid, for example).  The other categories are not quite so straightforward, and the ratio of opinion to fact goes up, but some general rules are still apparent. The classic typefaces in the two inner categories tend to be easy reads and vanilla in character, so they can be paired well with the boldest (far right) categories. There are also some very good pairings between the two middle columns (Georgia and Arial for example, are a classic combination).  
		Are there any categories I should never ever use together?   First of all, using two different typefaces from the same category will almost certainly lead to discord. Also, using too many loud, or striking typefaces, maybe matching a slab and geometric, typically isn’t good. In the same way it might be confusing to see a humanist serif with a powerful geometric sans.  

		Conclusions:  
		I hope that a quick look at these ideas will help you if you’re starting out and feeling a bit lost in a jungle of typography. This is only scratching the surface, I didn’t even touch decorative or handwritten typefaces or some of the nitty gritty of kerning or x-height in this article. There are plenty of resources for diving in further, the world of typography is wide and rich to explore. I have listed the sites I visited to create this article, for your perusing pleasure.
